# Goals Tracker Sheet ![](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/google-sheets.png)
### Currently it's a Google Sheet that breaks down your monthly goals into weekly goals and automatically adds them to a "Goals" list on Google Tasks.

## Open Source Mission
The vision for this project is to become a full fledged goal tracking solution entirely based in Google products. We welcome new collaborators with all skill levels, this project started as a learning experience and there's still a lot to be done and learned.

## Features to be Developed - Pick your ticket or Get in touch through e-mail.
- Checking off the task updates the spreadsheet.
- Create a "Project View" to track each goal's progress (see links below).

* These projects served as inspiration for this one. Using one of them as the frontend for this Sheets/Tasks/Calendar backend would be awesome. Let's not reinvent the wheel and let's use and credit these great open source repos.

...currently being poorly used. But I'd be glad if someone helped set things up for a better development experience.
